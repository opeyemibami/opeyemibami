### Hi there 👋
My name is Opeyemi Bamigbade. A  Data Scientist, Machine Learning and Systems Engineer. I combine my systems design, software and data science knowledge to build data-driven products that scale and solve problems. 

A PhD student with a research focus on Computer Vision Techniques for Digital Image & Video Forensic Geolocation👨🏻‍💻

- 🔭 I Created [TMOST](https://github.com/opeyemibami/Topic-Modelling-Open-Source-Tool). An open-source, topic modelling tool built on Natural Language Processing that enables users to preprocess, build, generate and download model reports on topic modelling without the need to code.
- 🌱 I'm Contibutor to [Danfojs](https://github.com/opensource9ja/danfojs). An open-source, JavaScript library providing high-performance, intuitive, and easy-to-use data structures for manipulating and processing structured data.
- 🌱 I enjoy doing [MLOps](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning), [ML-on-GCP](https://www.coursera.org/programs/697b2a08-db87-4463-a112-e1ac8c46b181/browse?productId=GWIdT4bQEeiFWQrjbTVkyg&productType=s12n&query=Machine+Learning+with+TensorFlow+on+Google+Cloud+Platform&showMiniModal=true), and web development for Ai products.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source tools for data science and machine learning.
- 💬 Ask me about Machine Learning and Data Science.
