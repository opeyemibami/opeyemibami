### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Opeyemi Bamigbade. A  Data Scientist, Machine Learning and Systems Engineer. I combine my knowledge of systems design, software and data science to build data driven products that scale and solve problems. 

**Strong Languages**: Python and JavaScript

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on [TMOST](https://github.com/opeyemibami/Topic-Modelling-Open-Source-Tool). An open-source, topic modelling tool built on Natural Language Processing that enables users to preprocess, build, generate and download model report on topic modelling without the need to code.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working and managing [Danfojs](https://github.com/opensource9ja/danfojs). An open-source, JavaScript library providing high-performance, intuitive, and easy-to-use data structures for manipulating and processing structured data.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [TFX](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx), [TFlite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite), [TFjs](https://www.tensorflow.org/js), [MLOps](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning), [ML-on-GCP](https://www.coursera.org/programs/697b2a08-db87-4463-a112-e1ac8c46b181/browse?productId=GWIdT4bQEeiFWQrjbTVkyg&productType=s12n&query=Machine+Learning+with+TensorFlow+on+Google+Cloud+Platform&showMiniModal=true), [Android-Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and web-interface for Ai products deployment.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source tools for data science and machine learning.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with making best version of myself
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Machine Learning and Data Science.
